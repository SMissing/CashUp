## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Port already in use (Web Interface)**
   - The web interface uses port 5000 by default
   - Stop other applications using port 5000 or modify `app.py`

2. **Missing dependencies**
   - Run `pip install -r requirements.txt`
   - Ensure you're using Python 3.7+

3. **Permission errors (Report saving)**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions in the directory
   - Check that the `Reports/` folder exists

4. **Tkinter not available (Desktop GUI)**
   - On Linux: `sudo apt-get install python3-tk`
   - On macOS: Usually included with Python
   - On Windows: Usually included with Python

### Getting Help

If you encounter issues:
1. Check the error messages in the terminal
2. Ensure all dependencies are installed
3. Verify Python version compatibility
4. Check file permissions

## Development

### Adding New Features

1. Core business logic: `cash_up_core.py`
2. Web interface: `app.py` and `templates/`
3. Desktop GUI: `desktop_app.py`
4. Configuration: `config.py`

### Testing

Run each interface separately:
- Web: `python app.py`
